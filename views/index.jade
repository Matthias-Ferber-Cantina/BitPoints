				BitPoints helps scrum teams estimate stories by getting rid of physical <em>scrum poker</em> decks and creating a more visible platform for team members to post and discuss points. Average estimates are automatically calculated and high/low estimates are highlighted for discussion. BitPoint is also perfect for distributed scrum teams, as team members can join from any internet-connected device.
